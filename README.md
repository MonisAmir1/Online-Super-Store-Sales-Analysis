Hello Github Community!👋 Check out my new Unguided Power BI End-to-End Practice Project. The objective is to conduct a complete analysis of historical online sales data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies impacting revenue growth. Quantify the impact of key performance indicators (KPIs) on overall sales performance and provide data-driven recommendations. Deliver a detailed report outlining findings, insights, and strategic recommendations to stimulate revenue growth and enhance business performance. 📈📊

I decided to try something new this time by recording myself and giving an overview of the entire project as if I were presenting to senior stakeholders. I thought it would help me improve my storytelling skills, according to the current industry. There's definitely a lot of room for improvement and your invaluable feedback will be instrumental in identifying those areas.
